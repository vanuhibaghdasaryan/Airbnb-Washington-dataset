# Dataset


For this project, I have used the "Inside Airbnb" dataset, which is a publicly available
dataset containing detailed information about Airbnb listings. The dataset includes
attributes such as property type, neighborhood, availability, number of bedrooms,
amenities, host information, and pricing information. The dataset also includes
geographical information, allowing for spatial analysis.
